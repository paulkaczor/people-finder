      "text": "(Updates with companies invited to meeting in 11th paragraph. See {EXT4 <GO>} for more on the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.)\n By Julianna Goldman\n      April 29 (Bloomberg) -- The worsening oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico may alter President Barack Obama\u2019s five-year plan to open new areas to offshore oil and natural gas drilling, administration officials said today.\n      \u201CObviously, what\u2019s occurring now will also be taken into consideration as the administration looks to how to advance that plan and what makes sense and what might need to be adjusted,\u201D said Carol Browner, Obama\u2019s adviser for energy and climate change. \u201CWe need to learn from the incident.\u201D\n      Obama has mobilized federal agencies and opened the door to putting more resources into the response to the spill from a damaged BP Plc well that is leaking about 5,000 barrels a day, five times more than previously estimated. The slick is expected to reach the Gulf Coast as soon as tomorrow, administration officials said today, and Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal has declared a state of emergency.\n      With Congress working on climate change and energy legislation, Obama proposed last month drilling for oil and gas off the U.S. East Coast and in the Gulf of Mexico 125 miles off the west coast of Florida. At the time, he said the plan is part of a transition to a new-energy economy that relies less on imported fossil fuel and more on domestic and renewable power sources, including solar and wind.\n      Before new offshore areas are opened to exploration, there will be public hearings and other chances for state officials and the public to have input, Browner said at a White House briefing on the spill response.\n      \u201CThat plan doesn\u2019t automatically open up an area to drilling,\u201D she said.  \u201CIt starts a process. And an area may or may not become open to drilling.\u201D\n      White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said the president will reserve judgment until the cause of the rig\u2019s explosion is determined.\n      \u201CI think our focus right now is, one, that -- the area, the spill; and two, also, to ultimately determine the cause of it and see the impact that that ultimately may or may not have.\u201D\n      When asked whether the administration would support a pause in new deep-water oil drilling, Deputy Interior Secretary David Hayes said, \u201CEverything\u2019s on the table.\u201D\n                       Meeting in Washington\n      Hayes said Interior Secretary Ken Salazar and other administration officials are scheduled to meet later today in Washington with executives and technical specialists from companies involved in offshore exploration to discuss what can be done to ensure safety on deep-water drilling rigs and platforms in the Gulf of Mexico. Salazar today ordered inspections of all deepwater rigs in the Gulf.\n      More than 30 companies were invited to the meeting this evening at the Interior Department including BP\u2019s USA Division, Chevron Corp., ConocoPhillips, Exxon Mobil Corp., Halliburton Co., Occidental Petroleum Corp. and Valero Energy Corp.\n      While \u201Cthe fundamental practice is safe,\u201D Hayes said the administration would be announcing additional steps in the coming days to ensure drilling safety.\n      \u201CWe have a thousand offshore platforms or mobile rigs in operation, producing 30 percent of our domestic energy supply. But we are determined to get to the bottom of it and to enhance the safety issues,\u201D he said.\n      Salazar said March 31 that the administration may be ready to have a sale of leases off the coast of Virginia by 2012.\n --Editors: Joe Sobczyk, Don Frederick\n To contact the reporter on this story: Julianna Goldman in Washington at jgoldman6@bloomberg.net\n To contact the editor responsible for this story: Jim Kirk at jkirk12@bloomberg.net\n  \t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\n  \t\t\t  \t\t\t\t  \t\t \t\t\tSponsored Links\n \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tOnline Forex Trading w/ ACM \t\t\t\t\t\tFree Forex Trading Software when you Open a Free Account Today!\n \t\t\t\t\t\n \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tAmerican Express - Savings \t\t\t\t\t\tSave with Confidence with an FDIC Insured Savings Account - Learn More.\n \t\t\t\t\t\n \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tGet \"Early Bird Alerts\" on Stock Picks! \t\t\t\t\t\tThe past 3 alerts have gained up to 146% - sign up now for next month's pick."
