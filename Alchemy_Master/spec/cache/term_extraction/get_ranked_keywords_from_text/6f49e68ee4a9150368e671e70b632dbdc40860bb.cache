      "text": "Bed and Breakfast locations are trade marked by their small size, antique furniture and homey feel. If this is the kind of B&B you are looking for, then The Custer House is where you should go. It is a five-minute walk from the beach, but in this turn of the century modified Queen Anne residence you'll be begging to stay longer.\n\nShe may not look like much on the outside, but visiting 10th Avenue Inn Bed and Breakfast will be worth the visit inside. A stunning panoramic view of the ocean that few can rival cheers guests from this quiet little Inn. Not only is the view pleasant, but the meals and tea are something to look forward to.\n\nThe Guest House Bed and Breakfast is the coziest and homiest of the B&B's in Seaside, Oregon. The warm wood paneling of the house is cheerful and clean-looking. A unique feature is the front facing balcony that invites you to enjoy the views day and night.\n\nOne cannot mention Seaside B&B's without mentioning The Gilbert Inn Bed and Breakfast. This is the most recommended location for romance and history. This Victorian style B&B right on the Promenade is quaint and scenic in all the best ways. The Turret Room offers a special way to spend your night and morning with a beautiful view of the ocean. This B&B is a must for those visiting Historical sites like the Butterfield Cottage and The Saltworks.\n\nSeaside B&B's are wonderful little getaways for the romantic couple, the history buff and those people who simply enjoy a good old-fashioned vacation.\n",
