      "text": "  \t\t\n      May 3 (Bloomberg) -- The growing oil slick fed by an underwater leak in a BP Plc well in the Gulf of Mexico may threaten production, shipping and refining of oil and natural gas in Mississippi, Alabama, and Louisiana.\n      Those three states account for 19 percent of U.S. refining capacity as of 2009, according to data from the U.S. Energy Department\u2019s Energy Information Administration.\n      \u201CTraders are nervous about how fast the slick could grow,\u201D and whether it could have a significant effect on oil and natural-gas production, said Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston.\n      The oil spill followed an April 20 explosion on a drilling rig leased by BP Plc that killed 11 workers. The rig, owned by Transocean Ltd., sank two days later.\n      President Barack Obama called the leak a \u201Cmassive and potentially unprecedented\u201D disaster that could affect the economy of the Gulf states and the jobs of those who depend on the Gulf for their livelihood.\n      The spill could drift west toward New Orleans, hindering ships entering and leaving the Mississippi River or deliveries of cargoes to the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port, Lipow said in a telephone interview today.\n      The LOOP, a deepwater port off of Louisiana, provides tanker offloading and receives oil from underwater pipelines. All operations are normal at this point, said Barb Hestermann, a spokeswoman for the LOOP.\n      \u201CWe don\u2019t anticipate being impacted,\u201D Hestermann said. \u201CWe\u2019re quite a bit west of the oil spill.\u201D\n      The LOOP handles about 10 percent of the nation\u2019s imports and 10 percent of domestic production via pipelines in the Gulf of Mexico operated by Shell and BP, she said.\n      \u201CWe\u2019re still receiving oil from both pipelines,\u201D Hestermann said.\n      If the slick moves east, crude deliveries could be interrupted to Chevron Corp\u2019s 330,000-barrel-a-day Pascagoula refinery in Mississippi, and a Shell Chemicals refinery near Mobile, Alabama, Lipow said.\n      \u201CWe continue to supply products to our customers,\u201D said Lloyd Avram, a Chevron spokesman.\n      Royal Dutch Shell Plc operates refining joint ventures with partners at four Gulf Coast refineries. The company also has Gulf of Mexico drilling operations, and recently started production at the deepest offshore Gulf platform, Perdido. Shell is monitoring the situation, including the \u201Ctrajectory and quantity of oil released to determine any potential impact on our operations,\u201D Ted Rolfvondenbaumen, a company spokesman, said in an e-mailed response to questions.\n                       Gas Platforms Closed\n      Two natural-gas platforms were closed and one evacuated as a safety measure, shutting in approximately 6.2 million cubic feet of gas, or less than one-tenth of one percent of daily gas production, according to a May 1 statement from the multiagency Joint Information Center coordinating the federal response.\n      The Coast Guard hasn\u2019t restricted commercial tanker traffic into the Mississippi River, said Petty Officer Cory Mendenhall.\n      The Southwest Pass, the main channel to the river, isn\u2019t affected by the spill, said Chris Bonura, spokesman for the Port of New Orleans. The river has 5,000 to 6,000 ship calls a year, he said.\n      \u201CEverything is clear and the forecast is clear through Tuesday,\u201D Bonura said. \u201CWe haven\u2019t had any ships canceled or delayed.\u201D\n      Valero Energy Corp., the largest U.S. independent refiner, operates five refineries located on the Gulf Coast.\n      \u201CAt this time, we\u2019re not expecting any disruptions to supply,\u201D Bill Day, a Valero spokesman, said in a telephone interview. \u201CWe have prepared equipment and expertise in case we\u2019re asked to assist with cleanup along the Gulf Coast since we have oil-spill response equipment.\u201D\n      There has been no effect on Marathon Oil Corp\u2019s platform in the Gulf of Mexico, and no disruption to its Garyville, Louisiana, refinery on the Mississippi River, said Lee Warren, a company spokeswoman.\n      There is no effect on production at Exxon Mobil Corp. facilities in the Gulf of Mexico, said David Eglinton, a company spokesman.\n      Koch Industries does not comment on potential supply disruptions, said Katie Stavinoha, a Koch spokeswoman. Flint Hills, a unit of Koch Resources LLC, operates a refinery in Corpus Christi, Texas.\n      BP is seeking ways to plug the leaks 5,000 feet under the water\u2019s surface. The company plans to drill a second well to take pressure off of the current gusher. The U.S. Coast Guard said it has been unable to get an accurate estimate of how much oil is leaking and is preparing for a worst-case scenario.\n      More than 2,000 people have been deployed to protect the shoreline and coastal wildlife, according to a statement from the Joint Information Center.\n      Surface estimates of the size of the slick and skimming efforts were hindered as the Coast Guard ordered boats and aircraft back to port because of stormy weather. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration previously estimated the well is spewing 5,000 barrels of oil a day. At that rate, the volume of the spill would exceed Alaska\u2019s 1989 Exxon Valdez accident by the third week of June.\n --With assistance from Aaron Clark in New York.
